# 🎮 Video Game Sales & Engagement Analysis

## ✅ Summary of the Project

This project analyzes video game datasets from multiple sources to understand **sales performance, user engagement, and market demand**. The analysis combines *vgsales.csv* (sales data) with *games.csv* (user engagement + ratings data). Using data cleaning, transformation, and dashboarding techniques, insights were generated to understand:

* Which games sell the most globally,
* Which genres are most popular,
* Which developers consistently produce high‑rated games,
* How wishlist, ratings, and backlog trends indicate user engagement.

## ✅ Business Problem

The gaming industry produces thousands of titles every year, but only a few succeed commercially. Game studios and publishing companies need clear insights into:

* Which **genres and platforms generate higher sales**,
* Whether **higher user engagement (wishlist, plays, ratings)** correlates with sales,
* Which **regions drive maximum revenue**,
* Which **games and studios are consistent top performers**.

Goal: Use data-driven evidence to help publishers and developers make informed decisions on future releases, marketing strategies, and platform targeting.

## ✅ Methodology (3 Steps)

1. **Data Cleaning & Transformation** – Handled missing values, merged columns (Title/Name, Genre/Genres), created a unified `Game_Title` field; performed unpivoting for regional sales breakdown.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** – Used Power BI dashboards to analyze ratings distribution, wishlist trends, sales by region, best-selling platforms, and publisher performance.
3. **Insight Generation & Reporting** – Built interactive visual dashboards and documented key insights with business implications.

## ✅ Results & Business Recommendations

### 🔍 Key Insights
